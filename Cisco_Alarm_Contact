! using the ALARM contact on a Cisco IR800 industrial router or an IE industrial switch.
! if the contacts are closed a logging event happens
! therefore logging should be enabled
! I have written a simple embeded event manager script to bring a GRE tunnel interface up once the switch is closed
! A simple dip switch for this testing was used

event manager applet ALARM_ON
 event syslog pattern "ALARM_CONTACT-0-EXTERNAL_ALARM_CONTACT_ASSERT"
 action 1.0 cli command "enable"
 action 2.0 cli command "conf t"
 action 3.0 cli command "int tun 100"
 action 4.0 cli command "no shut"
event manager applet ALARM_OFF
 event syslog pattern "ALARM_CONTACT-0-EXTERNAL_ALARM_CONTACT_CLEAR"
 action 1.0 cli command "enable"
 action 2.0 cli command "conf t"
 action 3.0 cli command "int tun 100"
 action 4.0 cli command "shut"
